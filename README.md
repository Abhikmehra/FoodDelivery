# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


1. Frontend (React)
To start the frontend part of the food delivery app, you typically have a React-based application. Here are the basic commands:
**cd frontend
**npm i
**npm run dev


2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
The backend usually involves setting up a server using Node.js with Express.js as the web framework. It handles API requests, user authentication, order processing, and more.
**cd backend
**npm i
**npm run server

3. Admin Panel
The Admin Panel is often a separate part of the application that allows managing orders, users, payments, etc. This can either be a part of the frontend or a separate dashboard.
**cd admin
**npm i
**npm run dev
