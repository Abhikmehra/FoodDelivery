Here's a detailed explanation of each step with the commands, including emojis for better clarity!

### 1. **Frontend (React) Setup** ⚛️

This section covers the frontend part of your food delivery app, built with **React**. You'll use **Vite** as the build tool for fast development, along with hot module replacement (HMR) and **ESLint** for code linting.

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd frontend`**: This command moves you into the `frontend` folder where your React project resides.

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`** (or **`npm install`**): This command installs all the necessary npm packages (dependencies) listed in your `package.json` file.

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - 🚀 **`npm run dev`**: This starts the Vite development server, allowing you to view your React app in the browser with live reloading (hot module replacement). The app will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. **Backend (Node.js/Express) Setup** 🖥️

The backend typically involves using **Node.js** with **Express** to handle API requests, order processing, and user authentication.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd backend`**: This moves you into the `backend` folder where your Node.js and Express server code resides.

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`**: Installs all necessary backend dependencies, such as Express.js, MongoDB drivers, and other required packages.

3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   - 🔧 **`npm run server`**: This starts the Express server. It typically listens on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`), where it handles API calls and backend processes for the app.

### 4. **Admin Panel Setup** 🛠️

The **Admin Panel** is used to manage various aspects of the food delivery app, like orders, users, and payments. It can be a standalone React dashboard or part of the existing frontend.

1. **Navigate to the admin directory:**
   ```bash
   cd admin
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd admin`**: This moves you into the `admin` folder where the Admin Panel (often built with React) is located.

2. **Install admin dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`**: Installs all required dependencies for the Admin Panel, similar to the frontend setup.

3. **Run the admin development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - 🚀 **`npm run dev`**: This starts the development server for the Admin Panel. Like the frontend, it will typically open in your browser with live reloading functionality.

By following these steps, you'll have your frontend, backend, and admin panel set up and running. Each part has its own isolated environment for development and testing, making it easier to manage. 😊
