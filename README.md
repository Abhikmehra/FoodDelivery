Here's a detailed explanation of each step with the commands, including emojis for better clarity!

### 1. **Frontend (React) Setup** ⚛️

This section covers the frontend part of your food delivery app, built with **React**. You'll use **Vite** as the build tool for fast development, along with hot module replacement (HMR) and **ESLint** for code linting.

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd frontend`**: This command moves you into the `frontend` folder where your React project resides.

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`** (or **`npm install`**): This command installs all the necessary npm packages (dependencies) listed in your `package.json` file.

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - 🚀 **`npm run dev`**: This starts the Vite development server, allowing you to view your React app in the browser with live reloading (hot module replacement). The app will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. **Backend (Node.js/Express) Setup** 🖥️

The backend typically involves using **Node.js** with **Express** to handle API requests, order processing, and user authentication.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd backend`**: This moves you into the `backend` folder where your Node.js and Express server code resides.

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`**: Installs all necessary backend dependencies, such as Express.js, MongoDB drivers, and other required packages.

3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   - 🔧 **`npm run server`**: This starts the Express server. It typically listens on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`), where it handles API calls and backend processes for the app.

### 3. **Admin Panel Setup** 🛠️

The **Admin Panel** is used to manage various aspects of the food delivery app, like orders, users, and payments. It can be a standalone React dashboard or part of the existing frontend.

1. **Navigate to the admin directory:**
   ```bash
   cd admin
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd admin`**: This moves you into the `admin` folder where the Admin Panel (often built with React) is located.

2. **Install admin dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   - 📦 **`npm i`**: Installs all required dependencies for the Admin Panel, similar to the frontend setup.

3. **Run the admin development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - 🚀 **`npm run dev`**: This starts the development server for the Admin Panel. Like the frontend, it will typically open in your browser with live reloading functionality.
